# VRVTUnityCoursework

This repository is for the Unity course work game in Vidzeme University Virtual Reality masters programme.

The game idea is that you are a dog who is left alone in a hot car. Your task is to get noticed by people outside by making as much noise as possible, before the car gets too hot and you die.
